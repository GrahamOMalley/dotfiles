************************************* SEARCH/REPLACE **********************************************************************************

* will highlight the word under the cursor

once:  s/fred/barney
every instance in a line:  s/fred/barney/g
every instance in n lines: (ie 104 lines:) +104s/fred/barney/g

every instance in a file: %s/fred/barney/g
confirm replace: +104s/word/replacement/cg

case insensitive: %s/fred/Barney/gi

NOTE: when replacing text, its often a good idea to use only that string, ie its better to do:
%s/\<fred\>/Barney/gi
so that you don't replace "alfred" with "alBarney"

%s/^M$//g - get rid of anooying ^M carriage returns (Use CTRL-V CTRL-M)

g/some string/d - delete any line that contains some string
